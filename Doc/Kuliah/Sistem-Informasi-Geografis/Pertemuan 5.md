Create Shapefile

 

 

 

1. Background

     Data is a value that represents a real object. For example; geographical environment, maps and others. This time I will explain about how to create geospatial data (create shapefiles). For more details will be discussed below.

 

2. Identification of Problems

    How the student / i know about how to create shapefiles?
    How do ordinary people know how to create geospatial data?

3. Exposure

     Shapefile is a common geospatial data format for geographic information systems software. Shapefile was developed and organized by ESRI's open specification for interoperability of data between ESRI and other soft data card products.

 

create shapefilenya:

>> Import shapefile

>> Sf = shapefile.Writer ( "name file.shp")

>> Sf.shapes ()

>> Len (a)

 

4. Solution from other sources
ESRI shapefile or so-called shapefile is a common geospatial data format for geographic information system software. Developed and managed by the ESRI as a specification (almost) open for the interoperability of data between ESRI and other software products.

[1] A "shapefile" usually consists of a set of files with extension ".shp", ".shx", ".dbf", and other extensions on a same name (e.g., "the street."). When use, shapefile actually refer to is the extension ".shp", but this file is incomplete and requires other files.

Shapefile spatial geometry is described by: points, lines, and extents. The geometry, for example, can represent, river, stream, and lake. Each section has an attribute that describes the attributes, such as the name of the river or the temperature.

 

5. Kesimpula and suggestions

   So, as a shapefile format geospatial data created and managed by ESRI for relations with other software products.
