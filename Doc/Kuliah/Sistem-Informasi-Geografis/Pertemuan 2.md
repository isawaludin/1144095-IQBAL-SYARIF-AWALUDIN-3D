Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Meeting 2: Spatial Data
Spatial Data




1. Background
    
       In keeping with the times, many applications are designed and created using the map feature. For example GoogleMaps, Go-jack and other applications. in this case required the introduction of the making of the map itself. To know how to create / find out about the map. So with this I explained a little about the Geographic Information System (GIS). Well, this time we will discuss about Data Sepasial. For explanations do not forget to read ya.

2. Identification of Problems

How the student / i and ordinary people know Spatial Data?
How the student / i and ordinary people know about Natural Earth?

3. Exposure Overview

4. Exposure

     Spatial data is the data that shows the graphical layout of the geographic space in the earth's surface in the form of points, lines and others. Spatial data consists of two parts:


Vector has a data type .Shpe file which is divided into 2; .shp And .dbf, .shp format as the coordinates of the geographical location of the earth, and .dbf format as a database of geographic data. For example, if the coordinates (shp) = 0.1, the database (.dbf) that appears = Bandung.
Ruster: has the type of image data comprising a Jpc 2000 and Ech.
     As for the so-called Natural Earth is the depiction of geographical surface of the earth (map) natural / real earth conditions. In Natural Earth there are several kinds of view can be displayed including;
Cultural: consist of data civilization, borders, boundaries, detail, conflict area, province, road, lane railways, airports, ports, parks, time zones, and cultural boundaries.
Physical: consists of coastline, islands, islets, coral reef zones, oceans, rivers, lakes, major city labels, intermintern lakes, Antarctic ice, glacier area, bathymetry, geographic lines, etc.
Raster: the coloring of the folder created.

5. The solution from Other Sources

     Spatial data is data that has a reference terrestrial space information systems (GIS) in which various attribute data located in different spatial units. This now becomes an important medium spatial data for planning and management of natural resources is sustainable in the coverage area continental, national, regional and local.
     Utilization of spatial data increased as digital mapping technology and its use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Spatial data formats can be either vector (polygon, line, points) and raster.

        Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset available at 1: 10m, 1: 50m, and 1: 110 million scales. Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations

    Thus, the spatial data is the data that shows the graphical layout of the geographic space in the earth's surface in the form of points, lines and others. As for the so-called Natural Earth is the depiction of geographical surface of the earth (map) natural / real earth conditions.
