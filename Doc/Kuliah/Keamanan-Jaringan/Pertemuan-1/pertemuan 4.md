Network Security: Sniffing



1. Background

     In the network world are familiar with the name of the technique sniffing on a network. In this matter, I will introduce about what is sniffing.

2. Identification of Problems
How the student / i know about sniffing techniques?
How do ordinary people know sniffing?

3. Exposure

     Sniffing is a cross-tapping on a computer network. Sniffing can be done by the network administrator to control servers. Sniffing is divided into two parts:
passive Sniffing
     Ie tapping without changing any data or packet networks and is commonly used on the hub. Due to the working principle of a hub that only forwards the signal to all computers.
Active Sniffing
     Namely sniffing activities that can make changes to network data packets in order to make sniffing is generally done on the switch.

Getting to Know the World Hacking: Sniffing
If you are users of computers connected in a network / network, eg in the office or cafe, then the introduction of one term in the world of hacking, sniffing, it becomes very important. Especially for those who like activities involving pengisianusername and password, such as email activity, e-banking, maintenance website or blog, purchase goods on the internet using a credit card, etc. What do sniffing activities use the username and password? Let's discuss it step by step:
definition sniffing
I took from wikipedia Indonesia, "Sniffer Package (meaning of text: packet sniffer - they can be interpreted 'packet sniffing'), also known as Network Analyzersatau Ethernet Sniffer is an application that can view data traffic padajaringan computer. Because the data flows back and forth on the network, the application captures each packet and sometimes describe the contents of RFC (Request for Comments) or other specifications. Based on the network structure (such as a hub or switch), either party can tap the whole or any of the traffic division of one of the machines on the network. Network control devices can also be managed by tapping to work in mixed mode (promiscuous mode) to "listen" items (generally on the cable network). "

5. Conclusions and Recommendations

     So, sniffing techniques are tapping technique is done through a computer network. To prevent it is advisable to use a secure network.
