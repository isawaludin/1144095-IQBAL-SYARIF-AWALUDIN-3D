Network Security: Meeting 2 Vurnabilities "ARP Poisoning"
ARP Poisoning

1. Background
 
     In the IT world surely you already know with the so-called network security. This time I will continue the tutorial material especially regarding ARP Poisoning. ARP poisoning itself is a weakness of the ARP, that is by manipulating the data network for the system to be error / not connect. Now for more details, then I will practice regarding this ARP Poisoning.

2. Identification of Problems

    How the student / i understand the use of the ARP Poisoning?
    How the student / i practice regarding ARP Poisoning?

3. Exposure Overview / Practice


4. Exposure

    Vurnabilities ie a situation where the system is experiencing weakness resulting in vulnerable and do not work well. Well, from the weakness that we can use the name ARP Poisoning / ARP Flooding, this time we will use ARP Poisoning.

     The other drawback of factors eg DNS. DNS weaknesses, data can be manipulated for example by replacing pass passnya be false. It is also concerned with the ARP system. ARP table shows the IP and Mac Address, so the function of transforming IP into the Mac Address. The disadvantage if you want to manipulate the first to change the contents of the table.

     Well, to practice it can be used to install python 2.7 on your windows, then scapy and pip and still adalagi other module.
     
5. Solution of the Other Resources

    Vulnerability is something that is related to a computer system that allows a person to operate and run it properly, or allowing unauthorized party (can hacker) took over. There are many types of vulnerability. There is a misconfiguration in the setup service, or a programming flaw service. Service is a program that runs on the Internet host port. Each service is a program that responds to commands - specific commands.
 
   Misconfiguration setup created a 'wiz' or 'debug' command is operating on older versions of sendmail, or an error setting permissions on the FTP server directory to be able to download the password file. In this case, the vulnerability is not an error when writing the program, but it tends to be on how the program is configured. Another example, the permissibility of file sharing on a Windows 95 or 98 when it is not necessary, or failure of a password on file sharing.

   Examples of error in programming service is a large number of buffer overflow vulnerability in the program running the service on port Internet host computer. Many buffer overflow problems have resulted in people can use the Internet to break down or control the host computer. Furthermore it can be seen in www.happyhacker.org.

    Knowing their vulnerability, of course we want to how to exploit. Before going any further, we peeled out what it exploit. Exploit is a program or techniques exploit a vulnerability. For example, the FTP-Bounce vulnerability when the FTP server is configured to redirect FTP connections to other computers. It is said to be a vulnerability because the feature 'bounce' allows the person utilizing the vulnerability to port scan a computer on the same LAN as the FTP server. Thus, even if a firewall may be keeping port scanners discanning directly by other computers on the same LAN, FTP server would bounce a scan past me-up firewall.

   Thus, the exploit is a technique to exploit the vulnerability so that we control or monitor the resource that we consider important. Exploit dependent and operating system configuration program - a program that runs on a computer system, and LAN.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations

      Vurnabilities ie a situation where the system is experiencing weakness resulting in vulnerable and do not work well. From a weak security system that would be bad for the system.
