DOS
"Denial Of Service"



Background

In the world of networks, of course taka sing with the name of a Denial of Service or DoS. In the world we also know the network DoS attacks. DoS attacks (English: denial-of-service attacks') is a type of attack on a computer or server in the Internet network by spending resources (resource) owned by that computer until the computer is not able to function properly so that it does not direct prevent other users to gain access to the services of the attacked computers.
            Forms of Denial of Service attacks are attacks initial SYN Flooding Attack, which first appeared in 1996 and exploit the weaknesses contained in the protocol Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

Discussion

DoS attacks (English: denial-of-service attacks') is a type of attack on a computer or server in the Internet network by spending resources (resource) owned by that computer until the computer is not able to function properly so that it does not direct prevent other users to gain access to the services of the attacked computers.

In a Denial of Service attacks, the attacker will try to prevent a user access to a system or network using several different ways, including the following:

Flooding the network traffic with a lot of data so that network traffic is coming from unregistered users will be unable to enter into the network system. This technique is referred to as traffic flooding.
Flooding the network with a lot of requests to a network service disedakan by a host so that requests are coming from a registered user can not be served by such services. This technique is called request flooding.
Interfere with communication between a host and a client that is registered by using a lot of different ways, including by changing the system configuration information, or even the physical destruction of the components and servers.
Forms of Denial of Service attacks are attacks initial SYN Flooding Attack, which first appeared in 1996 and exploit the weaknesses contained in the protocol Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Other attacks finally developed to exploit vulnerabilities present in the operating system, network services or applications to make that system, network service, or application can not serve the user, or even crash. Some of the tools used to perform DoS attacks was developed after it (even some freely available tools), including Bonk, LAND, Smurf, Snork, WinNuke, and Teardrop.

Nevertheless, attacks against the TCP DoS attacks are often performed. This is because the other type of attack (as well as filled the hard disk in the system, locking one valid user account, or modify the routing table in a router) requires network penetration in advance, the possibility of penetration is small, especially if the network system has been strengthened.



Conclusions and recommendations

Denial of service is a method that has been desperately trying various data. DoS attacks (English: denial-of-service attacks') is a type of attack on a computer or server in the Internet network by spending resources (resource) owned by the computer.
