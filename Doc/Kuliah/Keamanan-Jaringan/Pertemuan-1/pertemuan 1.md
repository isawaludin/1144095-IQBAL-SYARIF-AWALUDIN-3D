Network Security: Introduction Meeting 1
Introduction



1. Background

    The amount of access you can use requires us to be more safety in using our right (our account). Each social media certainly has its own security system. For example; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and so forth. The security system that serves as a safety of each user's privacy or the security of the server.
 In this case, the necessary introduction of more of the security system. To know how or what network security systems. So with this I explained a little about Network Security (Network Security).

2. Identification of Problems

     a. How do the students / i know and understand about Network Security (Network Security).
         b. How do ordinary people know and understand jaringn Security (Network Security).
3. Exposure Overview




4. Exposure

     We may already be familiar with the name of the security of your social media accounts or other network security. Well, it is not far different from the things we discussed today. Initially the system was in the wake of network Security settings on the basis of the concept of OSI Layer. Because the concept is very idealistic and we are already using TCP / IP and the OSI Layer concept was limited to just learning. OSI Layer consists of seven layers (layers). Here are the layers of the OSI Layer;

        
     Well, then we will discuss about TCP / IP. TCP / IP is already in use since the first, and therefore the programmer still developing the TCP / IP. Because TCP / IP is still very weak security. Here is the layer of the TCP / IP;
  - Application; As a line of communication that use the port as a gate acces.
     - Transport; As a way of communicating between devices, can be via TCP or UDP.
     - IP; As the identity of an addressing device. For example; 192.168.1.5
    - Network Access; As phisical layer that enables communication phisic (mac address).

    As for the so-called ARP. ARP provides IP and Mac address that serves to give a message in the form of broadcast. ARP weaknesses are;
     - ARP Poisoni; Messages in broadcastkan easily contaminated by the virus.
   - ARP Flood; When flooded by ARP, the system runs will be experiencing a delay process.
